    <h2>Today we are going to learn how to make bro´s most delicious pancakes</h2>

    <p>As convenient as a store-bought mix can be, every home cook needs a good buttermilk pancake recipe in their repertoire. Don't have a tried-and-true favorite yet? You're in luck! The Allrecipes community can't get enough of these classic buttermilk pancakes. Reviewers say they're light, fluffy, moist, and full of rich flavor. </p>
    <p>There's nothing like plain buttermilk pancakes topped with maple syrup. But, if you're in the mood to add something extra to your breakfast, you can! Optional mix-ins include chocolate chips, berries, and nuts. You could also add cinnamon and vanilla to the batter for a little extra warmth. Instead of syrup, you could top your buttermilk pancakes with jam or honey for a sweet twist on a classic.</p>

    <h2 class="titulo_2">Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="u_list">
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Leaveners</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Buttermilk</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>


    <h2 class="titulo_2">Steps:</h2>
    <ol class="o_list">
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</li>
        <li>Pour or scoop batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
